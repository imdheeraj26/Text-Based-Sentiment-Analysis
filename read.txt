Good Morning!! and welcome to this ceremony, my fellow graduates from this great institution. It's really an honor to be on your stage, witnessing the results of your determination and hard work. My path was… rather non-traditional, as I say. I never did this as a graduate. My classroom was frequently the crowded marketplace, the silent corners of libraries packed with old books, and the busy workshops of artisans throughout our varied land.

Today, rather than three separate stories, I would like to draw together strands from my experiences, hoping they have some resonance as you enter the world.

My journey began with a deep fascination – a curiosity about how things were made, how communities thrived, and the invisible forces that shaped our lives. As a young boy in my village, I would spend hours watching the potter’s wheel, mesmerized by how shapeless clay could transform into something beautiful and functional. I'd watch the weaver's complex dance with the loom, every thread weaving into a greater, glorious tapestry. I discovered early on that creation, whether in life or in art, is a process of patient commitment and an awareness of interconnectedness.

This curiosity took me down uncharted paths. After my education, rather than follow a traditional degree, I was drawn to the study of the origins of our culture and the craft that was dying slowly in the wake of modernization. I spent years going around India, staying with various groups, learning about their craft, their traditions, their knowledge. I apprenticed with a Kalamkari painter in Andhra Pradesh, staining my hands with natural pigments and learning the old stories etched into the fabric. I stayed with tribal groups in the forests of central India, learning about their deep affinity with nature and their sustainable living.

There were times of great joy, seeing the ingenuity and strength of our people. But there were times of great concern, seeing the loss of traditional skills and the struggles of marginalized communities. It was on these travels that I knew my vocation wasn't simply to learn, but to somehow bridge the gap between the old and the new, to seek ways to preserve our heritage in a fast-changing world.

This understanding wasn't an epiphany; it was a gradual revelation, like the slow opening of a lotus. There were moments when I questioned my direction. Others did too. Why wasn't I on a 'proper' career path? Why was I wasting my time studying apparently old-fashioned skills? There were days of doubt, when the future was uncertain and foggy.

But I persisted, driven by that initial spark of interest and an increasing sense of direction. I began small, facilitating artisans to reach directly into city markets. It was tough. I met skepticism, logistical hell, and times when I wanted to quit. But I recalled the unshakeable commitment of the Kalamkari artisan, the rhythmic accuracy of the weaver, the profound wisdom of the tribal elders. Their spirit continued to drive me.

Gradually, things started to change. People realized the beauty and value of things made by hand. The history of the pieces touched hearts. This movement started as a small initiative and became a movement that empowered the artisans, saved our cultural heritage, and established sustainable livelihoods.

In retrospect, I realize that my unorthodox education was the best I could ever have hoped for. The school was not in textbooks nor in auditoriums but in the rusty workshops, the colourful festivals, and the caring dialogues with fellow human beings of all strata.

As you stand here today, poised on the threshold of your own new beginnings, you have an impressive foundation of knowledge and skills. But do not forget that your education is not complete here. The world beyond these walls is a big and complicated classroom, full of opportunities and challenges no curriculum can fully prepare you for.

Be willing to take the unexpected detours. Welcome the unease of the unknown. Nurture your curiosity and let it lead you to places you never thought you'd go. Don't be afraid to blaze your own trail, even if it doesn't look like the ones everyone else is following.

And above all, recall the interdependence of all things. Your actions, small or large, create a ripple effect. Utilize your education, your skills, and your passion to do something bigger than yourselves. Be aware of the world and the communities you are a part of, and of the legacy you will leave.

The threads of your lives are only just beginning to be intertwined. Welcome the journey, learn from each experience, and never cease seeking knowledge and understanding. The tapestry of India, and the world, awaits the unique and lovely contribution that only you can make.

My very best to all of you. May your futures be filled with meaning, passion, and the heart to make your own remarkable tales. Namaste."
